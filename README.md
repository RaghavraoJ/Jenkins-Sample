# Jenkins-Sample
# Explanation of the Pipeline Code
agent any: Jenkins will run the pipeline on any available agent.
environment: The GitHub repository URL is stored as an environment variable.
Stages:
Clone Repository: Clones the GitHub repository into the Jenkins workspace.
Build: Runs the build step. You can replace the echo with actual build commands (like mvn clean install if you're building a Java project).
Test: Runs tests. You can replace the echo with real testing commands.
Deploy: This is a placeholder for a deployment step. You can add deployment commands depending on your project.
post: Defines actions that will be executed after the pipeline finishes. The always block runs regardless of the pipeline result, and success or failure blocks handle the respective outcomes.
# Add Credentials (if needed)
If your GitHub repository is private, you'll need to add credentials to Jenkins to access it.

In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials.
Add a new credential with your GitHub username and token (or password).
In the pipeline, modify the git step to include the credentials:
groovy
Copy code
git branch: 'main', url: "${GITHUB_REPO}", credentialsId: 'your-credentials-id'
# Run the Jenkins Pipeline
Save your Jenkins pipeline configuration.
Click on Build Now to run the pipeline.
You should see the pipeline execute the steps: clone the repository, build the project, and run tests.
# Push the Jenkinsfile to GitHub
You can also store the Jenkinsfile in the root of your GitHub repository and configure Jenkins to use Pipeline script from SCM to automatically pick up the pipeline script from your repository.

Create a Jenkinsfile in the root of your project repository with the same content as the pipeline script above.
In the Jenkins pipeline job, select Pipeline script from SCM.
Set the repository URL and branch, and Jenkins will use the Jenkinsfile for your pipeline.
